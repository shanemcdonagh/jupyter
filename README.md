# Graph Theory

## Introduction
This repository will be used as my learning environment throughout this current module, through **Python**. 

**Jupyter** is a platform in which we will use for data visualization and analysis 

## Learning Outcomes
- Learn about ideas and concepts within graph theory
- Visualize and conceptualize real world problems through graphs
- Explore and learn about the properties of graphs
- Solve complex problems be application of graph theory 

## Current Progress
- **Week 1**: Set up a Jupyter Notebook on GitHub and learned it's basic functions
- **Week 2**: Learned about Python conditions, lists, functions and variables
- **Week 3**: Explored lists further, alongside Tuples. Also implemented a Bubble Sort and Heap Sort algorithm
- **Week 4**: Refactored our implementation of Heap Sort and broke down how it works
- **Week 5**: Learned the basic definitons of sets, functions, boolean logic etc.
- **Week 6** Reading Week
- **Week 7** Learned of the purposes of exponents and logs and how they apply to Heap Sort
